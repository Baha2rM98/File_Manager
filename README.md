This is a library to manage files, if you're working on a project and you need to work with files you can use it!
NOTICE: this library is synced with java and kotlin only

How to use: add the  jar file to your project(how to add jar file depends on your IDE), 
enjoy it!

I will be glad if you guys help me to develop this library!
